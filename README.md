## Robin Collins

I am keen to obtain a junior developer role in a progressive and cutting-edge company, where I can grow and refine my programming skills, whilst also contributing to business growth and development. I am particularly interested in the cyber security space.

I have built up a broad range of experience from data processing and company analysis in the fund management industry, to developing client relationships and sales skills as a shipbroker. Most recently, I gained detailed insight into the use of technology in finance and insurance, particularly Blockchain, whilst in a business development role at an insur-tech start up. This led me to Makers Academy to gain genuine programming skills myself.
